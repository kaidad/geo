<p>In 1873, German immigrants Adolph Coors and Jacob Schueler established a brewery in Golden. Coors invested $2,000 in the operation, and Schueler invested $18,000. In 1880, Coors bought out his partner and became the sole owner of the brewery.</p>
<p>The Coors Brewing Company managed to survive Prohibition relatively intact. Years before the Volstead Act went into effect nationwide, Adolph Coors with sons Adolph Jr., Grover, and Herman established the Adolph Coors Brewing and Manufacturing Company, which included Herold Porcelain and other ventures. The brewery itself was converted into a malted milk and near beer production facility. Coors sold much of the malted milk to the Mars candy company for the production of confection. Manna, the company's non-alcoholic beer replacement, was a near beer which is similar to current non-alcoholic beverages. However, Coors and sons relied heavily on the porcelain company as well as a cement and real estate company to keep the Coors Brewing Company afloat. By 1933, after the end of Prohibition, the Coors brewery was one of only a handful of breweries that survived Prohibition intact.</p>
